# How To Create PKCS #12 For Your Application


This post is about creating [PKCS #12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12) to serve e.g. your content via HTTPS in your application itself or in another web container (such a Tomcat or another application server).

The PKCS #12 format is a binary format for storing cryptography objects. It usually contains the server certificate, any intermediate certificates (i.e. [chain of trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_trust)), and the private key, all of them in a single file. A PKCS #12 file may be encrypted and signed. PKCS #12 files are usually found with the extensions .pfx and .p12.

The PKCS #12 is similar to [JKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystore) format, but you can use it not only in Java but also in other libraries in C, C++ or C# etc, so I prefer this type of a keystore to be more general.

To use PKCS #12 inside your application, you have two way how to do it:

- [Create your own self-signed SSL certificate](#self)
- [Create a certificate using the Certificate Signing Request](#csr) (CSR, a.k.a [PKCS #10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS))

The first option is fast and simple, but not suitable for production environment. The second option is about creating CSR to be signed by any trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

## Create your own self-signed SSL certificate

When you need to create a new certificate as quickly as possible, run the following two commands:

### Generate a private key and a certificate in separated files using PEM format

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout myPrivateKey.pem -out myCertificate.crt -days 3650 -nodes
```

`openssl` – the command for executing OpenSSL.

`req` – certificate request and certificate generating [utility in OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/req.html). 

`-x509` – used to generate a self-signed certificate. 

`-newkey rsa:4096` - option to create a new certificate request and a new private key, rsa:4096 means generating an RSA key nbits in size. 

`-keyout myPrivateKey.pem` – use the private key file myPrivateKey.pem as the private key to combining with the certificate. 

`-out myCertificate.crt` – use myCertificate.crt as the output certificate name. 

`-days 3650` – specifies the number of days to certify the certificate for. 

`-nodes` - a created private key will not be encrypted.

### Combine a private key and a certificate into one key store in the PKCS #12 format

```bash
openssl pkcs12 -export -out keyStore.p12 -inkey myPrivateKey.pem -in myCertificate.crt
```
`openssl` – the command for executing OpenSSL. 

`pkcs12` – the PKCS #12 [utility in OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/pkcs12.html). 

`-export` - the option specifies that a PKCS #12 file will be created. 

`-out keyStore.p12` – specifies a filename to write the PKCS #12 file to. 

`-inkey myPrivateKey.pem` – file to read private key from. 

`-in myCertificate.crt` – the filename to read the certificate.

The wizard will prompt you for an export password. If filled, this password will be used as a key store password.

And that is all you need, use keyStore.p12 in your application.

## Create a certificate using the Certificate Signing Request

### Generate a private key and a certificate signing request into separated files

```bash
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -out request.csr -keyout myPrivateKey.pem -nodes
```

`openssl` – the command for executing OpenSSL. 

`req` – certificate request and certificate generating [utility in OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/req.html). 

`-newkey rsa:4096` - option to create a new certificate request and a new private key, rsa:4096 means generating an RSA key nbits in size. 

`-keyout myPrivateKey.pem` – use the private key file myPrivateKey.pem as the private key to combining with the certificate. 

`-out request.csr` – use request.csr as the certificate signing request in the PKCS #10 format. 

`-nodes` - a created private key will not be encrypted.

### Generate a certificate signing request from an existing private key

```bash
openssl req -new -key myPrivateKey.pem -out request.csr
```

`openssl` – the command for executing OpenSSL. 

`req` – certificate request and certificate generating [utility in OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/req.html). 

`-new` - generates a new certificate request. 

`-key myPrivateKey.pem` – specifies the file to read the private key from. 

`-out request.csr` – use request.csr as the certificate signing request in the PKCS#10 format.

Now it is time to send request.csr as a result of the previous step to your CA (Certificate Authority) to be signed.

You are almost done. When you get a new certificate for your request.csr from your CA, use it together with a private key to create a PKCS#12 file:

### Combine a private key and a certificate into one key store in the PKCS #12 format

```bash
openssl pkcs12 -export -out keyStore.p12 -inkey privateKey.pem -in certificate.crt -certfile CA.crt
```

`openssl` – the command for executing OpenSSL. 

`pkcs12` – the PKCS #12 [utility in OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man1/pkcs12.html). 

`-export` - the option specifies that a PKCS #12 file will be created. 

`-out keyStore.p12` – specifies a filename to write the PKCS #12 file to. 

`-inkey myPrivateKey.pem` – file to read private key from. 

`-in myCertificate.crt` – the filename to read the certificate. 

`-certfile CA.crt` – optional parameter to read additional certificates from, useful to create a complete trust chain.

The output file keyStore.p12 is what you need to add to your application. When you filled an export password use it as a key store password in a configuration file.
